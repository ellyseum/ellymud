# Todos Directory - LLM Context

> **For LLMs**: This file provides context for the todos scratch pad.
> **For humans**: See [README.md](README.md) for a brief overview.

## Overview

This is an **ephemeral scratch pad** for developers and agents working on the codebase. Contents are temporary, local, and **not meant to be committed** to version control.

## Purpose

Use this directory for:

- Brainstorming sessions and rough notes
- Planning data while working on tasks
- Agent pipeline working files and drafts
- Temporary research before formalizing elsewhere

## Conventions

### For Agents

- Feel free to create working files here during tasks
- Do not assume any specific files exist—each clone may differ
- Clean up files when work is complete
- Do not reference files in this directory from permanent documentation

### For Developers

- Use for personal notes and scratch work
- Contents are not shared across team members
- Consider adding `todos/` to `.gitignore` if not already present

## Gotchas & Warnings

- ⚠️ **Not Persistent**: Files here may be deleted or differ between clones
- ⚠️ **Not Tracked**: Do not rely on these files being in version control
- ⚠️ **Personal Space**: Each developer/agent has their own contents
