# Todos

Ephemeral scratch pad for developers and agents working on the codebase.

## Overview

This directory holds brainstorming sessions, planning notes, and working documents that are **not meant to be committed**. Each developer or agent may have different content in their local copy of this folder.

## Usage

Use this directory for:

- Temporary planning documents
- Research notes while investigating issues
- Agent pipeline working files
- Draft ideas before formalizing elsewhere

## Note

Contents of this directory are personal/local and should typically be in `.gitignore`. Do not rely on files here being present in other clones of the repository.
