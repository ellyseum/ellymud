# Documentation Agent Outputs - LLM Context

> **Purpose**: Storage for Documentation Updater Agent output artifacts

## Directory Role

This directory stores reports generated by the Documentation Updater Agent during pipeline execution. These reports document which README.md and AGENTS.md files were created or updated.

## File Naming Convention

```
docs_<topic>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.md           # Original report
docs_<topic>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>-reviewed.md  # After Output Review
docs_<topic>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>-grade.md     # Grade from Output Review
```

## Report Structure

Documentation reports should include:

1. **Affected Directories** - Which directories had documentation updated
2. **Files Created** - New README.md/AGENTS.md files
3. **Files Modified** - Existing files that were updated
4. **Changes Summary** - Brief description of what changed in each file
5. **Quality Verification** - Confirmation that paired documentation rule was followed

## Integration with Pipeline

The Documentation Updater Agent is invoked in **Phase 12** of the Problem Solver pipeline:

1. Problem Solver identifies directories affected by implementation
2. Documentation Updater creates/updates README.md and AGENTS.md
3. Documentation Updater produces report file in this directory
4. Output Review Agent reviews the report
5. Reviewed report is linked in final PR

## Git Ignore Rules

All `*.md` files in this directory are ignored EXCEPT:
- `README.md` (this file's human-readable companion)
- `AGENTS.md` (this file)

This ensures session-specific outputs don't clutter the repository.
