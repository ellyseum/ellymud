A stone circle marks the center, covered with moss and lichen that seems to pulse with life. Animals move freely through the grove - deer, foxes, birds - none showing fear of humans. Elder Greenbough stands within the stone circle, more tree than person.",

Totems carved from bone and wood stand at cardinal points, thrumming with spiritual energy. The floor is painted with an elaborate ritual circle, its symbols shifting subtly when you're not looking directly at them.

In the deepest shadows, Shadow teaches those who wish to walk the path of the Thief - for a price, and a promise of loyalty.",

It's the kind of place respectable citizens avoid, where deals are made in whispers and coin changes hands for things not sold in proper shops.
